## The Potential of Coding Standards

Coding standards have the potential to strengthen a programmerâ€™s capabilities through improving their code quality, given the standards are practiced properly. It is easy to shrug off coding standards as simply a tedious burden because many either do not understand the potential benefits, remember the specific details, or they save it all for the end which can be an excruciating task in itself on top of coding in the first place. The concept behind coding standards is that when offering a comprehensive set of guidelines and best practices for programmers to adhere to when writing code, then the quality of the software produced will be improved. Considerably, it is when a programmer has an understanding of these standards and puts them into practice as they code that the software and software engineer can benefit. Among these advantages is the improved consistency throughout the code, ensuring a uniform style and structural approach is followed. This consistency means that code is more readable and comprehensible, ultimately aiding collaboration among programmers as they can more easily work with and understand each other's code. Beyond consistency, coding standards also instill good programming practices that emphasize efficient and secure code. This leads to better code clarity while also reducing the likelihood of errors and vulnerabilities. By steadfastly adhering to coding standards, coders can produce software that is not only more robust, but also easier to maintain, ultimately strengthening their capabilities and quality in the long run.

## The Power of ESLint

ESLint, a widely accepted JavaScript analysis tool, plays a useful role in simplifying the implementation of coding standards. It was not until I learned to use ESLint that I came to realize that coding standards do not have to be a tediously detailed endeavor. Instead with ESLint, I was able to better recall, understand, and implement best practices and guidelines. ESLint automates coding guidelines compliance by highlighting and helping fix code that does not adhere to the predefined rules and guidelines. Perhaps one of my favorite aspects of ESLint is that automatic feedback is given as I go in my IDE. I found that small details such as spacing rules were easy for me to mix up or forget, so it was nice to have ESLint quickly make sure I got the rules correct or if not quickly fix the issue. For me, ESLint helped streamline my development process because it provided an easy way to follow coding standards as I coded. Overall, I believe that tools like ESLint will only continue to grow in their relevance and use by programmers because it creates a simple way to follow guidelines such that code can be of higher quality and readability.
