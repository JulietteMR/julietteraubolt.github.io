My interest in software engineering first began when I took a computer science course in college. I had never coded before but I quickly became hooked. The reward of working through a problem and getting past the challenges became addicting and I soon became a computer science major. Fast forward some classes and I find myself being asked the question “what do you want to do with computer science?”. The truth was I had no idea, in fact I had the same question, so whenever I was asked this I would have my fun and say the first computer science topic or project that came to mind. It was around this time that I got an internship at the University of California, Irvine working with the Physical Sciences Computer Support Group. It was through this opportunity that I was exposed to countless aspects of computer science and given a true glimpse of what different career routes could actually look like. To summarize my experience, I learned that I loved cybersecurity and did not love web development. 

Naturally, this put software engineering into a unique position. On one hand software engineering interested me in that it had application to cybersecurity and that freshman in college me still loved the rush of figuring out a problem. Though at the same time, I realized that there were so many more aspects of computer science that I wanted to spend my time doing, apart from developing software. Yet at the same time it could be so interesting and so satisfying with the right project. I went back and forth like this for some time and it really forced me to think about my true goals, passions, and interests. Ultimately I did make that commitment to a career in cybersecurity (how could you not) but that did not mean software engineering was out of the picture. Instead I found that software engineering was certainly still a relevant and intriguing field, even in the context of cybersecurity. Cybersecurity did not mean no software engineering, it simply meant a certain type of software engineering. One focused on scripting, reverse engineering, and vulnerability management or threat hunting in developed software. Nonetheless an exciting crossover. 

As I reflect on the role of software engineering in my future and specifically the kinds of skills and experiences I hope to develop, I feel confident and excited. Undoubtedly I want to develop software engineering skills that reflect cybersecurity topics. This means I want to learn how to write software that I feel secure about. I want to be confident in the essential software engineering skills such that I can use that knowledge to continue to grow and thrive in my career passions. Lastly, I want to understand software engineering so that I can analyze developed software, identify threats, and work to secure it. Software engineering is a dynamic field that I believe will only strengthen my capabilities and entice my passion for computer science and cybersecurity and so I look forward to continuing to grow my software engineering skills.
