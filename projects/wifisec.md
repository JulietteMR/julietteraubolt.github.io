One semester I was looking through the on campus jobs offered at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, debating if I should work that semester or not. When I came across a job listed as Cybersecurity Training my answer became a quick yes I should get a job if it means I could get this one. Upon beginning my new job I was excited to find that the subject of the semester was wifi security. This meant that I got to spend time researching and experimenting different wifi standards and smart devices that used the internet like smart light bulbs. 

It was an incredible opportunity to get more hands on experience with these principles and topics that we discuss in school. I got to gain confidence in using tools like Wireshark, Aircrack-ng, and Kali Linux to name a few. Each week I would work on understanding wifi fundamentals and correspondingly wifi traffic, logging what I learned and attempted each week. For instance one task was to crack a wifi network using WEP protocols through deauthenticating a user and capturing the 4-way handshake. Ultimately the final goal was to create a python script utilizing Scapy that would automate this work for me. Being able to gain a deeper understanding of how wifi works and how to confidently utilize various tools further grew my skills and passion for working in cybersecurity.
