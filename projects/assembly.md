While taking a course in assembly language we were tasked with a project that mimics a text editor. The task was to create a program that allowed users to add text via input or file, view, edit, delete, search, and save the text to a file. This project was done on a raspberry pi with arm64 architecture. I completed this project with a partner where we split the function amongst each other. Notably, this project built upon a previous project in the course that was about creating a string class that allowed a user to manipulate strings with various methods. Utilizing this initial string project we were able to call the functions we previously created while implementing the text editor. 

Learning assembly and doing these projects forced me to gain a deeper understanding of how computers work on a lower level. Even outside of the context of assembly, these projects helped me improve upon analyzing and walking through code to understand it as it was easy to lose where you were at when coming back to working on the project. This also revealed to me the value in good coding practices, especially when working with other people. Without a doubt these projects were challenging in how tedious they were, though there was something fun about being so deeply focused on coding your project that you begin to lose track of your surroundings and your mind gets set into assembly mode for a while.
